# Geometric Quality Assessment of Smartphone Photography
This repository contains the constructed Smartphone Camera Geometric Calibration(SCGC) dataset, which can provide quantitative geometrical information of image acquired by smartphones. 

# Dataset
We designed a 6x9 corner point checkerboard calibration plate, with each square measuring 2.54 cm per side. The SCGC dataset, consisting of 19,852 photos of the checkerboard taken by 63 smartphones of 7 mainstream brands, can be downloaded at the [Baidu Yun](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1lqHyVcE6X_7WW7iwonYSLA) (Code: cbne).
